			<h3>My Future Carrer Plans</h3>
			<p>Currently at the University of South Carolina, I am majoring in psychology and minoring in forensics planning to earn my Bachlor of Science degree. After graduating I am hoping to return to school to become a forensic pyschologist. Recently however I have taken interest in computer science, since taking CSCE 102. I might consider double minoring in computer science or pursuing a carrer in it.</p>
			<p class="hidden" id="pp"> In the second semester of my sophmore year, I hope to join Psi Chi, an international honor society in pyschology. In order to be elligable for admission I must maintain at least a 3.0 GPA in all psychology courses and maintain a GPA that keeps me in the top 35% of my class. I also hope to further my education by partcipating in an internship. I am specifically interested in working in a mental health institution.</p>
